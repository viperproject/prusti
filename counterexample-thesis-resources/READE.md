This repo contains resources that are part of my thesis.

It will be removed from the branch that will be merged to prusti-dev master but kept around in some archive branch.

It contains examples to test the counterexamples for various data structures and their results of the current version and other things, like the set of prusti-tests that fail verification and were annotated with our idea of an optimal output from a counterexample generator.

silicon.jar is a version of silicon that also prints contents of the store and heap.
