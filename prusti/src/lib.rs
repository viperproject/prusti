//! Prusti is a Rust compiler driver that provides an intermediate layer
//! between the compiler and verification tool. Its main responsibility
//! is to provide a convenient access to program's CFG with contracts.
//!
//! # Prusti Design
//!
//! Prusti registers attributes for specifying programs:
//! `#[requires="<precondition>"]`, `#[ensures="<postcondition>"]`, and
//! `#[invariant="<loop invariant>"]`. The registration and control of
//! the entire workflow is done by the rustc driver implemented in the
//! `lib/driver.rs`.
//!
//! The Rust compiler exposes procedures for parsing strings into Rust
//! AST, but it does not expose procedures for type-checking AST.
//! Therefore, Prusti rewrites ASTs of annotated procedures in the
//! callback ``after_parse`` to include specifications so that they are
//! type-checked during the regular rustc type-checker's pass. The
//! rewriting logic is defined in the modules `parser` and `typeck` and
//! the data structures for storing information about specifications are
//! defined in the module `specifications`. Please see the documentation
//! of the module `parser` for more information.
//!
//! The main Prusti logic is invoked as `after_analysis` callback.
//! During this pass, Prusti reconstructs specifications with types and
//! invokes a verification tool and gives it a facade trait that can be
//! used by the verification tool to query Prusti for all needed
//! information. This trait is defined in the crate `prusti_interface`.
//!
//! TODO: Implement `prusti_interface`.
